Use callout to draw a user’s attention to important snippets of static information.

## Do

- use sparingly as they are intrusive
- use to help users quickly scan to find essential information in a long text page
- use to reiterate important content
- use for quotes in long-form content
- use different tones and variants on the same page to convey information hierarchy
- use to format content not included in the main text such as support and contact details, checklists, definitions and ‘Did you know?’ content.

## Don’t
- embed form inputs in Callouts
- use in conditionally revealed checkbox or radio groups
- make them the focus of content; they are a supporting tool
- use for errors and alerts – use a Page alert or Section alert instead
- use for primary content, as it may be missed
- mix colour palettes.

## Related components
* Global alert – Global alerts display prominent service or system wide messages at the top of the screen.
* Message – A message is a colour-coded, non-disruptive notification that provides Success, Error, Warning or Information messages within a page at relevant times during the user journey. They should not be confused with Callouts.

## Related patterns
Messaging – Messaging conveys contextual information to the user, provides information in relation to a service or interaction, and provides feedback in response to their actions or the current system status.
